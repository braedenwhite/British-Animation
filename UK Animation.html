    <div class="column1"><h2> Overview</h2><p>In the 1940's, Disney had practically cornered the animation
        market. But in 1954, that all changed with the release of Animal Farm. Animal Farm led the way for 
        many British animtions to emerge. Most of them all were more mature and critically praised. However,
        in the 80's, a new animation studio named Aardman started releasing more kid friendly cartoons and they
        proved to be just as commercially viable and critically praised as the previous films.

         <p> There have been many influential animation directors that have come from the UK.
             These include Martin Rosen, Nick Park, Peter Lord and Richard Williams.</p>
