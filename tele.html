    <div class="column1"><h2> Camberwick Green (1966)</h2>
        <p>Camberwick Green was the first British animated television show. The 13 episode series
             used stop-motion to show the lives of the fictional British city of Camberwick Green.
              While not technically revolutionary, the show has a very warm and nostalgic feel that
               makes it very well liked to this day.

         <h2>Bagpuss (1974)</h2>
         <p>Bagpuss was another 13 episode series about the adventures of a stuffed pink cat. 
             The show revolutionized television puppeteering through the frog toy who is able to play
              the banjo and sing. The film is considered the best British television show according to a 2001
               BBC poll. An interesting fact about the Bagpuss is that the cat was supposed to be colored 
               orange but there was a mistake with the dye that turned it into a pink cat.

             motion puppet, into a two dimensional environment. However, other than its achievements 
             in animation, the film is not remembered much.
