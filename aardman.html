    <div class="column1"><h2> Morph (1977)</h2>
        <p>The first ever project by Aardman, Morph was a series of short films about a clay figure
             who always got into trouble. Morph later appeared in several projects by the studio
              including the music video “Sledgehammer” and the show, “Take Hart”. The character is 
              most important for helping Aardman hit the ground running as an animation powerhouse.

         <h2>A Grand Day Out (1989)</h2>
         <p>This short film was the introduction of Wallace and Gromit, arguably Aardman's most 
             popular franchise. The film features Wallace and Gromit going to the moon in search
              of cheese for their crackers. The short film inspired three sequels and a feature film
               in 2005.

             <h2>Chicken Run (2000)</h2>
         <p> The most critically and financially successful Aardman film, this film was directed
            by Nick Park. This film was important because it was the first collaboration between
             Dreamworks and Aardman, resulting in many more films like “Pirates! Band of Misfits”.
              The film is still widely regarded as one of the best pieces of animation to this day.
        </p>

             <h2>Flushed Away (2006) </h2>
         <p> The first ever CGI feature from Aardman features an underground city of rodents beneath
              London. The film is important because it exemplifies Aardman reaching out and trying
               new things. While their first venture into computer animation was a relative flop, 
               Arthur Christmas, a 2011 3D animated film, is considered to be a modern christmas classic.

             <h2>Shaun the Sheep (2007-present)</h2>
         <p>
            Following the adventures of Shaun and his live in the barn, Shaun the Sheep has been
             one of the most important television shows of the last year. This show is very important
              for continuing to use stop motion, even in the modern era of television. The television show
               is on its seventh season and has spawned two movies and a spin-off called “Timmy Time”.
